# Apologies

A web-based simulation parody of the board game *Sorry!*  
Guess which player will win. Get it wrong? The multiverse doubles.  
Get it right? It collapses... and grows a new dimension.

## Features

- Auto-simulating game logic
- 3D and 4D rendering of simulations
- Exponential punishment for incorrect predictions
- Purely client-side â€” gamble with your CPU, not your soul

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
